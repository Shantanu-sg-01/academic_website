## Reading & Inspirations
#### Books, papers, podcasts and ideas I am currently exploring

---

#### Books

- *[Elementary Flight Dynamics](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003096801/elementary-flight-dynamics-introduction-bifurcation-continuation-methods-nandan-sinha-ananthkrishnan)* by Prof. Nandan K. Sinha & Prof. N. Ananthkrishnan, reconnecting with my favorite topics, equations, and approaches in flight mechanics.
- *[Thinking Functionally with Haskell](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/thinking-functionally-with-haskell/79F91D976F0C7229082325B41824EBBC)* by Richard Bird, a complete mindset shift in programming. It’s functions all the way down - even integers are functions! Haskell really makes programs feel like math.
- *[The Science of Functional Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/sofp?authuser=0)* by Sergi Winitzki. My new muse! 
- *[Leaves of grass](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292281/leaves-of-grass-by-walt-whitman-edited-with-an-introduction-by-malcolm-cowley/#:~:text=About%20Leaves%20of%20Grass,-Abraham%20Lincoln%20read&text=Unlike%20many%20other%20editions%20of,and%20includes%20newly%20commissioned%20notes.) by Walt Whitman, Got hooked on “O Captain! My Captain!” and then “O Me! O Life!”… and haven’t stopped since.

#### Papers & Articles

- “[Why Functional Programming Matters](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/32/2/98/543535)” by John Hughes – a timeless classic, that still inspires, sometimes I catch myself saying, “That’s why functional programming matters!” — it really sticks with you.
- *[Hardware and Software for approximate computing](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/items/35539bb1-4ebb-4fce-a44b-b86aa389255d)* by Adrian Sampson, a visionary PhD thesis. If these ideas materialize, we’re looking at a major shift in computing.

#### Talks & Blogs

- Simon Peyton Jones' lectures on Haskell - deep, fun and full of insights. 
- Ted talks related to teaching, always a great source of inspiration.
