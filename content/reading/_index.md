## Reading & Inspirations
#### Books, papers, podcasts and ideas I am currently exploring

---

#### Books

- *Elements of Flight Dynamics* by Prof. Nandan K. Sinha, reconnecting with my favorite topics, equations, and approaches in flight mechanics.
- *Thinking Functionally with Haskell* by Richard Bird, a complete mindset shift in programming. It’s functions all the way down - even integers are functions! Haskell really makes programs feel like math.
- *Leaves of grass* by Walt Whitman, Got hooked on “O Captain! My Captain!” and then “O Me! O Life!”… and haven’t stopped since.

#### Papers & Articles

- “Why Functional Programming Matters” by John Hughes – a timeless classic, that still inspires, sometimes I catch myself saying, “That’s why functional programming matters!” — it really sticks with you.
- *Hardware and Software for approximate computing* by Adrian Sampson, a visionary PhD thesis. If these ideas materialize, we’re looking at a major shift in computing.

#### Talks & Blogs

- Simon Peyton Jones' lectures on Haskell - deep, fun and full of insights. 
- Ted talks related to teaching, always a great source of inspiration.
