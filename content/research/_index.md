## Research Focus
---

I’m broadly interested in using mathematics and programming to solve problems in science and engineering. My current focus is on the use of functional programming — especially Haskell — for building tools and frameworks in scientific computing.

Applied mathematics shows up in almost every aerospace sub-domain. Final selection of application area for projects will be made after a short 1:1 discussion to ensure alignment of interests. That said, I am still sharing application areas I am planning to explore:

+ Design of satellite constellation missions with coverage planning
+ Conceptual design of aero-vehicles for planetary or space exploration
+ Scheduling problems for airline operations
+ Multiphysics modeling (ex - coupled heat transfer and structures)
+ Aircraft Design with special focus on electric-powered and hydrogen-powered powerplants
+ Machine-learning for modeling fluid flows and structurs
+ Quantum computing for aerodynamics

#### Core Research Areas

- Functional Programming for Scientific Computing  
  HPC integration, algorithmic reformulation, and mathematical modeling using Haskell.

- Numerical Analysis and Computational Methods  
  Solvers and schemes for differential equations, simulations, and physical systems.

- Optimization Algorithms and Strategies  
  Gradient-free, multi-fidelity, and surrogate-based approaches for engineering design.

#### Open Projects & Mini-Projects

Students can take up mini-projects or supervised learning tracks (as extra-curricular work) focused on:

- Solving benchmark problems  
- Contributing to tool or library development  
- Building capacity for final-year projects or future research roles  

All projects aim to be intellectually rewarding and practically useful.

#### Research Group Policies

Once you're in the group, you'll be part of an active learning environment where we:

- Conduct training on reading papers, identifying gaps, presenting work  
- Encourage collaboration and peer feedback  
- Form formal project groups from within the research group itself  

To apply, just send me a 3-line email expressing your interest and background.
