## Research Focus
---

I’m broadly interested in using mathematics and programming to solve problems in science and engineering. My current focus is on the use of functional programming — especially Haskell — for building tools and frameworks in scientific computing.

Applied mathematics shows up in almost every aerospace sub-domain. Final selection of application area for projects will be made after a short 1:1 discussion to ensure alignment of interests. That said, I am still sharing application areas I am planning to explore:

+ Design of satellite constellation missions with coverage planning
+ Conceptual design of aero-vehicles for planetary or space exploration
+ Scheduling problems for airline operations
+ Multiphysics modeling (ex - coupled heat transfer and structures)
+ Aircraft Design with special focus on electric-powered and hydrogen-powered aircrafts
+ Machine-learning for modeling fluid flows and structurs
+ Quantum computing for aerodynamics
+ Flight mechanics of airships

#### Core Research Areas

- Functional Programming for Scientific Computing  
  HPC integration, algorithmic reformulation, and mathematical modeling using Haskell.

- Numerical Analysis and Computational Methods  
  Solvers and schemes for differential equations, simulations, and physical systems.

- Optimization Algorithms and Strategies  
  Evaluation of Multi-disciplinary optimization architecture, high-fidelity design optimization using adjoint methods, optimal control with simultaneous design optimization problems.

#### Open Projects & Mini-Projects

Students can take up mini-projects or supervised learning tracks (as extra-curricular work) focused on:

- Solving benchmark problems  
- Contributing to tool or library development  
- Building capacity for final-year projects or future research roles

#### Research Group Policies

Once you're in the group, you're part of an active, collaborative, and professional learning environment. We aim to grow together — as thinkers, researchers, and creators. Here's how we work:

*Research Training*
We conduct regular training on how to read research papers critically, identify gaps in literature, and articulate research questions.

*Collaborative Culture*
Collaboration is encouraged across projects. Peer discussions and constructive feedback are part of the weekly routine, to troubleshoot commonly faced problems.

*Weekly Check-ins / Sync-ups*
Everyone is expected to give brief weekly updates. These help track progress, unblock issues, and keep ideas flowing.

*Project Documentation*
Maintain a shared research log or notebook (markdown or overleaf) with clear records of objectives, decisions, and results.

*Version Control (Git)*
All code must be managed through GitHub (or similar), with clean commit history and meaningful documentation.

*Academic Integrity*
Plagiarism, code copying, or misrepresenting contributions is strictly prohibited. Always cite sources and give credit where it's due.

*Respect Deadlines*
We value each other’s time. Set realistic goals and communicate proactively if you're unable to meet them.

*Openness to Learning*
You are not expected to know everything. Asking questions, making mistakes, and learning from them is a core part of research.

*Mentorship & Peer Support*
Senior students are encouraged to mentor juniors. We grow faster when we teach each other.

*Code of Conduct*
Respect diverse perspectives, communicate kindly, and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all.
