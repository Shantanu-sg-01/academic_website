#### Office Hours & Meeting Policy

+ Quick chats: Feel free to walk into my office anytime during working hours if it's a brief query (under 10â€“15 minutes).

+ Longer discussions: Please book a slot on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/shantanu_as-mvjce/office-houre-in-person) at least 2 hours in advance. This helps me plan and ensures we can talk without being rushed.

#### Volunteer Opportunities

I'm looking for a few enthusiastic students to assist with academic activities related to computing and programming. If you're excited by tech and want to be part of something meaningful, reach out during office hours or email me.
