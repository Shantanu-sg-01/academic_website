## For Student
### Ways to Connect, Collaborate, and Contribute
--- 
#### Interested in Working With Me?

If you're interested in doing a mini-project or exploring a long-term idea with me—whether or not it counts for academic credit—take a look at the [Research page](https://shantanu-sg-01.github.io/homepage/books/). It gives an overview of my current focus areas and projects. I'm always happy to collaborate with motivated students, especially if you're building skills for future coursework or just want to explore something exciting outside the classroom.

#### Office Hours & Meeting Policy

+ Quick chats: Feel free to walk into my office anytime during working hours if it's a brief query (under 10–15 minutes).

+ Longer discussions: Please book a slot on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/shantanu_as-mvjce/office-houre-in-person) at least 2 hours in advance. This helps me plan and ensures we can talk without being rushed.

#### Volunteer Opportunities

I'm looking for a few enthusiastic students to assist with academic activities related to computing and programming. If you're excited by tech and want to be part of something meaningful, reach out during office hours or email me.
