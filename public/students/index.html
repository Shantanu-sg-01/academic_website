    <h1>For Students</h1>

    <h3>Interested in Working With Me?</h3>
    <p>Got an idea for a cool project? Want to explore something beyond the usual classwork? I’m happy to work with students on mini or long-term projects—even if it’s not for credits. It could help you later with coursework, research, or just learning something new. Check out the <a href="https://shantanu-sg-01.github.io/homepage/books/">Research page</a> to see what I’m currently into, and feel free to drop by or message me if you’d like to collaborate.</p>

    <h3>Office Hours & Meeting Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick chats:</strong> Feel free to walk into my office anytime during working hours if it's a brief query (under 10–15 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Longer discussions:</strong> Please book a slot on <a href="https://calendly.com/shantanu_as-mvjce/office-houre-in-person">Calendly</a> at least 2 hours in advance. This helps me plan and ensures we can talk without being rushed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
    <p>I'm looking for a few enthusiastic students to assist with academic activities related to computing and programming. If you're excited by tech and want to be part of something meaningful, reach out during office hours or email me.</p>

    <h3>GATE Exam Preparation Test Series</h3>
    <p>We're running a weekly GATE test series within the department.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New questions will be released every Monday (across different subjects).</li>
        <li>Submission deadline: Sunday evening</li>
        <li>Discussion: Following Monday</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To participate, join our Google Classroom using this code: <strong>2cj3b5cf</strong></p>
